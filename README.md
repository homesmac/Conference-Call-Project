# Conference-Call-Project

“What I really meant to say…”

Analyzing 5,320 quarterly earnings conference calls from the companies comprising S&P 500 over the past 6-10 years, can we predict whether a company will hit or miss their projected revenue numbers based on the words spoken on their calls? Using TF-IDF, sentiment analysis, and past performance and future predictions, this project is designed to see if a reasonable prediction can be made of future revenues. 

Models to be tested are Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosted Classifier, Random Forest, and Logisitic Regression.

Features engineered are sentiment, current quarter, length of call, and previous quarters' performance.
